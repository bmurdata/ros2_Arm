# ros2_Arm
Following the ROS 2 Udemy course to learn robotics basics.

# Setup:


Ubuntu 22.04 VM- Jammy Jellyfish
ROS 2 Iron

Why not Ubuntu 24? I had issues following the course with more modern Ubuntu and ROS2. Solving them was more time consuming that it was worth so I used older version of both.

Things I learned so far:
How to use STL in gazebo/ros
